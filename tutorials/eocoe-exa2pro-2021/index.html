<h2 id="abstract">Tutorial Abstract</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://skepu.github.io">SkePU</a> is a C++ based open-source framework for high-level
portable programming of heterogeneous parallel systems
using <i>algorithmic skeletons</i>. 
Skeletons are generic programming constructs 
based on higher-order functions,
such as <i>map</i>, <i>stencil</i>, <i>reduce</i>, <i>scan</i>, 
that implement algorithmic patterns for which platform-specific parallel implementations may exist.
Skeletons provide a high degree of abstraction and portability 
with a quasi-sequential programming interface, as their implementations 
encapsulate all low-level and platform-specific details 
such as parallelization, synchronization, communication, memory management, 
accelerator usage and other optimizations.
</p>

<p>
From the same high-level source code using SkePU skeletons and
data-containers, the framework generates target code for
multicore CPU execution, CUDA and OpenCL code for execution
on GPU and multi-GPU systems 
(and other OpenCL devices such as Xeon-Phi), hybrid CPU-GPU
execution, and on HPC clusters. 
SkePU transparently performs a number of
run-time optimizations, including data transfer minimization,
data locality optimizations and 
auto-tuned back-end selection. 
</p>

<p>
The SkePU framework is organized
as an include-only template library plus a light-weight
pre-compiler based on LLVM clang; the cluster backend
uses the MPI support in the StarPU runtime system.
The development of SkePU started in 2010, and we recently
presented the third generation of the framework.
Beyond cooperative research projects such as 
<a href="https://exa2pro.eu">H2020 EXA2PRO</a>, 
we use SkePU since
several years as a lab environment for teaching high-level
parallel programming in our 
<a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD56">master-level course on multicore and GPU programming</a>
at 
<a href="https://www.liu.se">Link&ouml;ping University</a>, Sweden.
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial we present SkePU with its skeletons and
data-container types, guide participants through 
some hands-on programming exercises in SkePU, 
and also point out some
of the more recently added new features 
such as multi-variant user functions 
(which can be used by platform expert programmers 
to exploit 
e.g. custom SIMD instructions without compromising
the portability of the SkePU program).
The source code of SkePU is available at
<a href="https://skepu.github.io">skepu.github.io</a>;
for fast installation 
we also provide a binary
distribution of SkePU for x86-64 Linux and a docker image.
</p>
<p>
The objective of this tutorial is to provide a good overview of the capabilities
and ease of use of SkePU to potential users in industry 
and academia, as well as to researcher colleagues 
in EoCoE and other HPC related projects.

<h2 id="outline">Schedule</h2>

<p>
Time frame: 23/2/2021, 09:00-12:30 CET
</p>
					
<p>
<b>1. Introduction to Programming in SkePU</b><br>
(45min,  A. Ernstsson / C. Kessler)
</p>

<p>
SkePU (https://skepu.github.io) is a C++ based high-level programming framework
for heterogeneous parallel systems and clusters. Its programming interface is based
on so-called algorithmic skeletons, i.e., predefined generic program constructs
based on higher-order functions, which express common parallelizable patterns
such as map, reduce, stencil, or scan, which can be customized in problem-specific
C++ code, and for which sequential and parallel implementations are available
for different execution platforms. From the single, quasi-sequential SkePU
source code, platform-specific parallel code is automatically created.
In this presentation, we give a more in-depth overview of the SkePU concepts
and programming interface, preparing for the subsequent exercise sessions.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Programming in SkePU: Guided Exercise and Advanced Issues</b><br>
(45min, A. Ernstsson, J. Ahlqvist)
</p>

<p>
We demonstrate programming in SkePU with a complete example jointly
for all participants, and also discuss some performance aspects and advanced issues.
</p>

<p>
Break (30min)
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Individual work session</b><br>
(90min, A. Ernstsson, J. Ahlqvist, C. Kessler)
</p>

<p>
For this session we expect that participants install or have installed SkePU on
some Linux system accessible to them (GPU or cluster architecture is not required).
For fast installation we provide a binary x86-64 Linux distribution of SkePU
(for ubuntu 18.04 and possibly other Linux variants) as well as a docker image;
it is also possible to install SkePU from source, see 
<a href="https://skepu.github.io">https://skepu.github.io</a>.
We encourage participants to bring their own problems or C++ application codes
for porting to SkePU. As alternative, we will provide further example problems for
participants to experiment with programming in SkePU at their own pace.
We will set up a shared queueing mechanism for providing individual assistance
on a first-come first-served basis.

<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite Knowledge and Special Requirements</h2>

<p>
<b>Prerequisite Knowledge:</b>
</p>
<p>
General interest and some background in parallel and heterogeneous computing.
</p>
<p>
For the programming exercises, some background in modern C++ and programming under Linux.
</p>

</section>
		
<!--
<section>
 -->
 <p id="requirements"><b>Special Requirements:</b></p>

<p>
  SkePU runs under Linux.
  We encourage participants to bring their laptop for
  hands-on programming in SkePU, and we try to help with
  installation issues if there should be any.
</p>

<p>
  We will also demo some examples on screen for all participants 
  who prefer not to try it out immediately.
</p>

<p>
  We encourage participants to install SkePU before the
  tutorial so we can make better use of the time.
  Detailed instructions will follow.
